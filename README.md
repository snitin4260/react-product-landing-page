# Product Landing Page with React
This project was based off my earlier [project](https://github.com/snitin8994/product-landing-page). I wanted to understand React more. What better way to learn  than to create project with the library. I wanted to migrate an existing Project to React. Component based designs are definitely the way to go.This project also made use of CSS modules. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
